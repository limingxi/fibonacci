fibonacci
=========
Recursive function is very useful in many situations. However, in some cases it calculate the subproblem more than once which leads it to waste a lot of time. The nth fibonacci generator is a good example for this. I worte this program to show how many function calls are called to get the nth fibonacci number. The program will iteratively ask for input (input n indicates you want the nth fibonacci number). and it will output the nth fibonacci number and how many function calls are called.
